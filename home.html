        <p>I am interested in High Performance Computing, and using Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulations to study compact objects and galaxy dynamics. I have a strong background in observational astrophysics and Python. I am currently leading a research group analyzing pulsar search surveys with the goal of discovering new pulsars to contribute to the pulsar timing array, and conducting research studying sulfur abundancies in planetary nebulae (PNe). </p>
        <p>I have also conducted research projects searching for Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) and Space Plasma Physics, and have spent a lot of time reading about simulation research. I started designing my own N-body and smooth particle hydrodynamics simulations in my free time. I am a captain of Franklin and Marshallâ€™s DIII Mens rowing team and active in organizations such as the Student Athletic Leadership Council. </p>
