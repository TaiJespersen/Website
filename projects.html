                <h3>How Access Was Gained:</h3>
                <p>During my Freshman year, I responded to an email from Dr. Crawford regarding my interest in his research and the NanoSTARS program. I have worked with him on his research since and was elected as a team leader at the start of my Junior year.</p>

                <h3>Research Description and Contribution:</h3>
                <p>I analyze survey data from radio telescopes searching for new pulsar signals. I filter radio frequency interferences, record redetections of known pulsars, and refold selected candidates for signal confirmation and further study. I have also used Python to program tools to sort and aid in sifting through data...</p>

                <h3>Research Skills Developed:</h3>
                <p>I have learned how to interpret data, processes and information related to surveys and observational astrophysics, and how to utilize skills in Python programming within research...</p>

                <p>During the winter of my sophomore year I applied to conduct research at West Virginia University (WVU) as part of their summer REU program...</p>

                <h3>Research Description and Contribution:</h3>
                <p>In this project, I developed Python code to aid in loading, preparing, and analyzing data from Cluster mission crossings of the Auroral Acceleration Region (AAR)...</p>

                <h3>Research Skills Developed:</h3>
                <p>In the field of plasma physics I learned how to work with data taken by a spacecraft, and developed my skills in Python...</p>

                <h3>How Access Was Gained:</h3>
                <p>I had read about Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) also known as Lorimer Bursts, and coincidentally Dr. Lorimer, who originally discovered these signals, worked at WVU where I was actively doing research...</p>

                <h3>Research Description and Contribution:</h3>
                <p>After receiving the data, I wrote Python code to organize and upload it. I learned to check single pulse FRB data and taught my group to repeat this process...</p>

                <h3>Research Skills Developed:</h3>
                <p>While working on this project, I built skills to organize and complete research independently.</p>
