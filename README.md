# Tai Jespersen

Welcome to my personal website! Here, you'll find information about my research projects, my resume, and a bit about me. This site is hosted using GitHub Pages.

## 🔭 About Me
I am interested in High Performance Computing, and using Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulations to study compact objects and galaxy dynamics. I have a strong background in observational astrophysics and Python. I am currently leading a research group analyzing pulsar search surveys with the goal of discovering new pulsars to contribute to the pulsar timing array, and conducting research studying sulfur abundancies in planetary nebulae (PNe). 

I have also conducted research projects searching for Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) and Space Plasma Physics, and have spent a lot of time reading about simulation research. I started designing my own N-body and smooth particle hydrodynamics simulations in my free time. I am a captain of Franklin and Marshall’s DIII Mens rowing team and active in organizations such as the Student Athletic Leadership Council.
